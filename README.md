**This repository provide a free courses and tutorials to learn the field of Data Science. I provide some of the best free resources and tutorials in English and Arabic.**
# First, let's answer some important and serious questions
## 1- What is  Data Science ?
* Data science is the study of data. It involves developing methods of recording, storing, and analyzing data to effectively extract useful information. The goal of data science is to gain insights and knowledge from any type of data — both structured and unstructured. 
* Data science refers to the process of extracting clean information to formulate actionable insights. 

## 2 -Do data scientists get paid well?
* The average salary for a data scientist is Rs. 698,412 per year. With less than a year of experience, an entry-level data scientist can make approximately 500,000 per year. Data scientists with 1 to 4 years of experience may expect to earn about 610,811 per year 

## 3 - Is data science a good career?
* Yes, data science is a very good career with tremendous opportunities for advancement in the future. Already, demand is high, salaries are competitive, and the perks are numerous – which is why Data Scientist has been called “the most promising career” by LinkedIn and the “best job in America” by Glassdoor

## 4 - What are the 3 main concepts of data science?
* Statistics, Visualization, Deep Learning, Machine Learning are important Data Science concepts

## 5 - Does data science require a lot of math?
* When you Google for the math requirements for data science, the three topics that consistently come up are calculus, linear algebra, and statistics. The good news is that — for most data science positions — the only kind of math you need to become intimately familiar with is statistics

## 6- What is future of data science?
* The future of data science is bright, and with increased applications across domains, its prospects are immense. Along with artificial intelligence and machine learning, data science will contribute towards a higher level and intelligent decision-making for businesses

## 7 - Waht is Data Analytics	?
* Data analytics helps individuals and organizations make sense of data. Data analysts typically analyze raw data for insights and trends. They use various tools and techniques to help organizations make decisions and succeed.

## 8- What is  Data engineering ? 
*  Data engineering is the practice of designing and building systems for collecting, storing, and analyzing data at scale.
*  Data engineers work in a variety of settings to build systems that collect, manage, and convert raw data into usable information for data scientists and business analysts to interpret. Their ultimate goal is to make data accessible so that organizations can use it to evaluate and optimize their performance


# Prepare your workspace
* Anaconda: It’s a tool kit that fulfills all your necessities in writing and running code. From Powershell prompt to Jupyter Notebook and PyCharm, even R Studio (if interested to try R)
* Atom: A more advanced Python interface, highly recommended by experts.
* Google Colab: It’s like a Jupyter Notebook but in the cloud. You don’t need to install anything locally. All the important libraries are already installed. For example NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Sci-kit Learn
* PyCharm: PyCharm is another excellent IDE that enables you to integrate with libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib, allowing you to work with array viewers and interactive plots.

## This track is divided into 3 phases: 
1. Beginner: you get a basic understanding of data analysis, tools and techniques.
2. Intermediate: dive deeper in more complex topics of ML, Math and data engineering.
3. Advanced: where we learn more advanced Math, DL and Deployment.


## Syllabus

### Mathematics, statistics, and probability
- Because this is the basis by which you will understand the data and understand how to build machine learning Algorithms and how to work with them.

### Data Analysis 
- you will use programming languages, tools and techniques to answer this question " What happened? "

### Machine Learning 
- You will learn machine Learning and its algorithms and apply them to the data to answer the question, "What will happen in the future?"

### Deep Learning
- working with unstructured and big data.
